#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. The emergence of software engineering has made it possible for applications to be developed to help in our daily lives by helping us to communicate with ease over long distances, in terms of healthcare, bussiness and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. The development of programming languages to assist programmers in writing codes.
b. The creation of mobile applications that help in specific aspects of our lives based on what the application is created to do.
c. The development of web applications that assist us to have access to the world wide web. These applications help us to get information on the internet and also interact with other users of the internet.
d. Development of operating systems like windows, iOS, android,etc to help computers run smoothly. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirement. Gathering and documenting information on the needs of users and the what the system will also need.
b. Designing. Creating the framework of your software. Getting detailed framework of your software and the interface; how it should look like.
c. Implementation. Writing codes and creating software based on the specified designs and framework.
d. Testing. Test running the software to assertain the functionality of the software and check if it meets the neccessary requirements.
e. Deployment. Making it available to users.
f. Maintenance. Enhancing the functionality making neccessary updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodologies require the completion of one stage before moving to another development stage while the agile methodologies use frequent feedbacks and short stops to make changes to software. The waterfall methodology is good for projects which have predictale outcomes and can be used by inexperienced developers. The Agile methodology is good for projects whose outcomes are not predictable or are unknown. They are appropraite for projects whcich require new ideas based on market needs and need to be changed frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. Software Developer. The software developer writes codes and provides software solutions when needed and also ensures the software functions at all times.
b. Quality Assurance Engineer. They ensure a project meets quality requirements before it is launched. They monitor every stage of the product development and suggest corrections after test running with their testing plans formulated
c. Project Manager. They oversee the planning, orginizing, directing and delivery of projects. They serve as a bridge between the project planning and its execution. They ensure the product meets all standard requirements and meets the deadline.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDEs improve the productivity of the developer by providing a set of combined capabilities such as building software, debugging, testing and  packaging in an easy to use application while the VCS 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
